# About PhotoEditor SDK & VideoEditor SDK for React Native

Our SDKs provide tools for adding photo and/or video editing capabilities to your React Native application for iOS and Android with a big variety of filters that can be previewed in realtime. Unlike other apps that allow a live preview of filters, PhotoEditor SDK and VideoEditor SDK even provide a live preview when using high-resolution images and videos.
Additionally, we support adding stickers and text in a non-destructive manner, which means that you can change the position, size, scale and order at any given time, even after applying other effects or cropping the photo.

## How to run the examples

This repository contains two example applications. The `Catalog` app demonstrates the most common use cases of the SDKs that do not require any native modifications. The `CatalogUI` example shows how to apply customizations to the user interface using the integrated native interfaces.

For the individual steps to run the application, please follow the instructions of the individual application's README.
